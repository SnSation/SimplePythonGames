Goals & Constraints
-------------------------

- Develop 3 Games with Python: Hangman, Blackjack, and a simple Dungeon Escape
- Applications should run in the CLI
- Applications should run in a Jupyter Notebook
- Minimize package use
- Stretch: Games applications can run independently, or accessed from a single, unifying application
- Stretch: Progress / Game State can be saved between sessions

Key Features
------------

**Core Feature:**
- All applications accept, utilize, and respond to user input

**Secondary Feature:**
- Applications have the option to reset without exiting
- Returns and Outcomes change relative to User Input
- Applications can run in the CLI

Integrated Technology
-----------------------
**Language(s):**
- Python

**Libraries / Packages / AddOns:**
- Jupyter Notebook

Starting with Simple Python Games
-------------------
### Start Up
1. Clone the [Simple Python Games](https://github.com/SnSation/SimplePythonGames/ "Download Simple Python Games") Repository
2. From your terminal, run `games.py` with `python` OR run a specific game from the `SimplePythonGames/games` directory

### Alternate Start Up
1. Clone the [Simple Python Games](https://github.com/SnSation/SimplePythonGames/ "Download Simple Python Games") Repository
2. From your terminal, open `jupyter notebook`
3. Open the notebook in your browser
4. In your browser, navigate to the `SimplePythonGames` directory, and open `SimplePythonGames.ipynb`


Using Simple Python Games
------------
### Blackjack

**Objective(s):**
- Objective 1
- Objective 2

**Rules:**
- Rule 1
- Rule 2

**Controls:**
- Control 1
- Control 2

### Hangman

**Objective(s):**
- Guess letters to reveal the hidden word before you are hanged!

**Rules:**
- 6 letters can be guess incorectly before you lose the game
- Each correctly guessed letter will reveal all instances of it in the word
- You can ask for a hint, but it will count against your incorrect letter count

**Controls:**
- `Hangman.py` accepts lowercase letters and integers
- Use the `enter` key to make your choices
- Letters are guesses
- Integers are menu-related inputs

### Dungeon Escape

**Objective(s):**
- Objective 1
- Objective 2

**Rules:**
- Rule 1
- Rule 2

**Controls:**
- Control 1
- Control 2
